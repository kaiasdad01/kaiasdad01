- ðŸ’» I'm a data product & analytics leader, with 10 years of experience in both enterprise and startup environments. 

- ðŸ’¾ I'm currently at Amazon building with the Pricing Tech team for Amazon Shipping. Previously, I led an Analytics team at Walmart, was an early tech PM at Minoan Experience, and spent the first 3 years of my career in corporate finance at L'Oreal. The common thread in every step of my career has been a focus on leveraging data & analytics to build strategy and drive successful biz outcomes. 

- ðŸ“š I've got an MBA from Dartmouth, and am currently pursuing an MS Computer Science at CU Boulder part-time. 

- ðŸ”­ Outside of my day job, I love to build, and learn. Currently working on a few cool projects like: NFL analytics & predictions platform and a better way to track and evaluate real estate listings.

- ðŸ’¬ I love to talk all things data, new tech, and AI/ML. Or, ask me about east coast skiing (or Colorado skiing too I guess), the (definitive) best breakfast burrito in the Colorado front range, or how to optimize credit card points for travel.
