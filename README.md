- ðŸ’» I work at Amazon as a Data PM in our shipping business ðŸšš. I spend my days working with engineers, data scientists, and BIEs to build products that provide reliable, high quality data for use in negotiations and strategic planning.

- ðŸ’¾ Before Amazon, I was an analytics leader at @walmart (via Jet.com!) and a technical PM at @minoan. If you haven't heard of Minoan, you have to check them out. Incredible team building game-changing experiences for STR hosts & guests. Native Retail is the real deal!

- ðŸ“š I've got an MBA from Dartmouth, and am currently pursuing (part-time) an MSCS at CU Boulder.

- ðŸ”­ Outside of my day job, Iâ€™m currently working on a pipeline to ingest & analyze real estate data becasue I want to buy a house, and I need to build some tech & a series of models to feel confident. Also kicking off a project to explore ways to help people optimize the use of their credit card points & airline miles, because it's way too hard to get good value out of your points.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ecommerce / retail, pricing, real estate and logistics. Alternatively, ask me about east coast skiing (or Colorado skiing too I guess), the (definitive) best breakfast burrito in the front range, or how to optimize credit card points for travel.
