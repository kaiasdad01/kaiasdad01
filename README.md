- ðŸ’» I'm a senior data PM, with experience building data products & analytics platforms end to end in both enterprise and startup environments. 

- ðŸ’¾ I'm currently at Amazon building with the Pricing Tech team for Amazon Shipping. Previously, I led an Analytics team at Walmart, was the first tech PM at Minoan Experience, and spent the first 3 years of my career in corporate finance at L'Oreal. 

- ðŸ“š I've got an MBA from Dartmouth, and am currently pursuing an MS Computer Science at CU Boulder.

- ðŸ”­ Outside of my day job, I love to build. Currently working on a few cool projects like: NFL analytics & predictions platform, a better way to track and evaluate real estate listings, and a product to help people use their credit card points & airline miles more effectively. 

- ðŸ’¬ I love to talk all things data, new tech, and AI/ML. Or, ask me about east coast skiing (or Colorado skiing too I guess), the (definitive) best breakfast burrito in the front range, or how to optimize credit card points for travel.
