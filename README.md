- ðŸ’» I work at Amazon as a Data PM in our shipping business ðŸšš. I get to work with amazing engineers, data scientists, and BIEs to build products that provide reliable, high quality data for use in negotiations and strategic planning.

- ðŸ’¾ Before Amazon, I was an analytics leader at @walmart (via Jet.com!) and a technical PM at @minoan. If you haven't heard of Minoan, you have to check them out. Incredible team building game-changing experiences for STR hosts & guests. Native Retail is the real deal!

- ðŸ“š I'm currently an MS Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder (#skobuffs and TY Coach Prime). My undergrad was in Finance and I have an MBA from Dartmouth as well. 

- ðŸ”­ Outside of my day job, Iâ€™m currently working on a pipeline to ingest & analyze real estate data becasue I want to buy a house, but the housing market is scary and data projects bring me peace. Also kicking off a project to explore ways to optimize retail operations for small businesses (like your local ski shop).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to integrate dbt into workflows, as well as new tools outside of AWS (though AWS is great!).

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ecommerce / retail, pricing, and logistics. Alternatively, ask me about east coast skiing (or Colorado skiing too I guess), the (definitive) best breakfast burrito in the front range, or how to optimize credit card points for travel.
